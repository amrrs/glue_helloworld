Just checking out this R-package `glue` that I haven't come across before. 


```{r results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(glue)
library(magrittr)

df <- mtcars
```

```{r}
glue('This dataset has {nrow(df)} rows and {ncol(df)} columns')
```


```{r}
mtcars %>% glue_data("{rownames(.)} has {cyl} cylinders and {hp} hp")
```
